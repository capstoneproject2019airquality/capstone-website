                        <p align="left">
                          Salt Lake County oversees a vehicle emissions testing program to ensure compliance with federal air quality standards.
                          Motorists annually spend millions of dollars for inspections carried out under this program.
                          <br/></br>However, it is not subject to cost controls and suffers from programmatic inefficiencies wherein
                          a large number of compliant vehicles undergo testing and a small number of high-polluting vehicles forgo timely repair.
                          Using survey-based emissions test pricing data, we assess through empirical and spatial autocorrelation
                          analysis the potential economic impact of instituting both emissions test price caps and subsidies to fund compliance repairs.
                          </br><br/>
                          We conducted two sub-projects: Project A - Economic revision of testing services price schemes; Project B - Modelling of emission test failures.

                      <p align="left">The Salt Lake County vehicle emissions testing program suffers from uncontrolled transactional cost burdens for motorists and is not capable of tracking noncompliant vehicles.
                          How can we leverage Salt Lake County test pricing and vehicle data to reduce cost inefficiencies for motorists and enable tracking capabilities for local government?
                          This project proposes to support Salt Lake County regulators in the exploration and development of new cost efficiencies and noncompliant vehicle tracking capabilities.
                          <br/></br>We seek to accomplish the following: the identification of testing price points that can accomplish a decrease in cost per ton of reduced pollutant emissions while preserving service
                          availability within the testing provider network, and discernment of patterns in noncompliant vehicle use through ensemble classification methods.

                          Domain knowledge of our mentor indicated that filtering specifically by zip code will allow users to quickly select the most convenient facilities,
                          while price filter will add transparency to existing pricing schemes and provide
                          a more informed and economically transparent facility selection process.

                          To support stakeholder decision-making, we have calculated multiple statistics on testing in the county based on the data. We estimated number of initial tests per test result in each year (2017-2018). We calculated the average cost of testing and
                          average price across all tests.

                              <li align ="left">Average price of all OBDII tests is currently 33.95$ (to compare, in Cache County, UT price cap is set at 15$, so the difference is significant).Initial results and all statistics have been reported to the stakeholder.</li>

                      <p align="left"> Major risks of the project are associated with communication and delivery.
                        In the research plan we indicate that some steps might require iteration - those include analytical framework development and application development.
                        Therefore, timely delivery will highly depend on successful collaboration with the stakeholder, and among team members, to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings and extensions.
                        </br><br/>
                        Another risk resides in the team’s capability to deliver high quality products to the end users.
                        Because our stakeholder is a government institution and our work might have sufficient impact on the entire vehicle emission test program,
                        it is crucial to ensure we meet expectations and produce high-end deliverables.
                        </br> <br/>
                        To mitigate this risk we often sought advice from more experienced peers, eg.
                        We have contacted professional UX designer to conduct our application tests.
                        We also tried to quickly identify potentially difficult tasks and issues to address them together and find solutions during team calls or meetings.
