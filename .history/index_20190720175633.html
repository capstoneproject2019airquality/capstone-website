                        <p>The Salt Lake County vehicle emissions testing program suffers from uncontrolled transactional cost burdens for motorists and is not capable of tracking noncompliant vehicles. How can we leverage Salt Lake County test pricing and
                            vehicle data to reduce cost inefficiencies for motorists and enable tracking capabilities for local government? This project proposes to support Salt Lake County regulators in the exploration and development of new cost efficiencies
                            and noncompliant vehicle tracking capabilities.we seek to accomplish the following: the identification of testing price points that can accomplish a decrease in cost per ton of reduced pollutant emissions while preserving service
                            availability within the testing provider network, and discernment of patterns in noncompliant vehicle use through ensemble classification methods.

                            test rejected due to insufficient data from the vehicle’s onboard computer (OBD).

                        <p>The methodology includes stratified sampling of the testing provider population,primary data collection with phone surveys and spatial analyses comprised of local Moran's I map for all test & OBDII test by calculating correlation
                            coefficient that measures the overall spatial autocorrelation of the dataset; kernel density for station locations, all test counts for each location, and OBDII test counts for each location; a geographically weighted regression
                            standard residual map for all test count and OBDII counts; and normal spatial distribution including population distribution and spatial joined choropleth map for all test count and OBDII test counts.

                        <p>
                            1. We have built a prototype web application that displays locations of testing facilities with detailed information on each of them and filter feature based on zip code and price range.Application will be used by county residents and our intuition and
                            domain knowledge of our mentor indicated that filtering specifically by zip code will allow users to quickly select the most convenient facilities, while price filter will add transparency to existing pricing schemes and provide
                            a more informed and economically transparent facility selection process.
                            </br>
                            <img src="images/pic014.jpg" width="750" height="450" /></br>
                            2. The main outcomes from our analysis include Managers suggested average of 35$ (similar to current county average) as proposed price cap. Around 63% of managers claimed not to offer testing after a price cap is introduced. 60% of managers would be willing
                            to participate in government subsidy programs that would foster timely repairs.</br>
                            <img src="images/pic015.jpg" width="500" height="500" opacity="0.8" /></br>
                            3. To support stakeholder decision-making, we have calculated multiple statistics on testing in the county based on the data. We estimated number of initial tests per test result in each year (2017-2018). We calculated the average cost of testing and
                            average price across all tests.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Around 7% of initial OBDII tests do not pass, where 4% results are rejects (vehicle not yet ready to take the test due to technical conditions), and 3% are fails (vehicle did not pass the test).</li>
                                <li>Average price of all OBDII tests is currently 33.95$ (to compare, in Cache County, UT price cap is set at 15$, so the difference is significant).Initial results and all statistics have been reported to the stakeholder.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h2 class="major"> Conclusions</h2>
                        <p> Major risks of the project are associated with communication and delivery. In the research plan we indicate that some steps might require iteration - those include analytical framework development and application development. Therefore,
                            timely delivery will highly depend on successful collaboration with the stakeholder, and among team members, to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings and extensions. Another risk resides in the team’s capability to deliver high
                            quality products to the end users. Because our stakeholder is a government institution and our work might have sufficient impact on the entire vehicle emission test program, it is crucial to ensure we meet expectations and
                            produce high-end deliverables. To mitigate this risk we often sought advice from more experienced peers, eg. We have contacted professional UX designer to conduct our application tests. We also tried to quickly identify potentially
                            difficult tasks and issues to address them together and find solutions during team calls or meetings.
