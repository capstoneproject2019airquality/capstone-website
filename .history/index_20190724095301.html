                        <p>Salt Lake County oversees a vehicle emissions testing program to ensure compliance with federal air quality standards. Motorists annually spend millions of dollars for inspectionscarriedoutunderthisprogram. However,itisnotsubjecttocostcontrolsand
                            suffers from programmatic inefficiencies wherein a large number of compliant vehicles undergo testing and a small number of high-polluting vehicles forgo timely repair. Using survey-based emissions test pricing data, we assess
                            through empirical and spatial autocorrelation analysis the potential economic impact of instituting both emissions test price caps and subsidies to fund compliance repairs. Our results indicate testing providers have an overall
                            negative view towards regulatory price caps but a majority would voluntarily participate in a subsidized repair program.

                        <h2 class="major"> Data </h2>
                        <p> <strong>1.County-wide testing service provider records dataset</strong>
                            </br> The dataset contains average per-station testing price data for the first two months of 2019 including 435 rows of detail for each test station within Salt Lake County: a unique station ID, test fees, the station name,
                            and street address along with city name and zip codes. The data are limited in that they do not contain point geographies, detail on any additional taxes and fees, and station type categorization. This initial dataset was limited
                            in that it did not contain point geographies and applicable fees or tax additions to prices, nor did it discern service providers offering test services from those that supplement testing with repair services.
                            </br>
                            <strong>2.Survey resulting dataset</strong></br>The resulting dataset provided the population of test providers from which we later drew a stratified simple random sample of 35 providers to conduct the more detailed price cap
                            and repair subsidy survey. This data also supported the public-facing interactive web application that allows county motorists to explore test provider location and price details. </br>
                            <strong>3.Specific-vehicle emissions testing results dataset</strong>
                            </br>The dataset contains 1.646 million observations on individual emissions tests for years 2017 and 2018, covering vehicle characteristics of model year, type, class, and weight, and test parameters of test station ID, location,
                            type, and test result. The station ID key permitted a join to the original pricing dataset containing geocoded point locations, thus permitting removal of the hard-to-standardize location variables.

                    <div class="content">
                        <h2 class="major"> Methodology </h2>
                        <p><strong>1. Stratified sampling and phone call survey</strong></br>
                            Our sampling plan and survey questions focused on three objectives: assessing the viability of a price cap for all emissions tests in Salt Lake County; assessing how many stations would still offer testing at a price of 15 dollars; and assessing the providers’
                            interests in participating in a program subsidizing needed repairs to comply with emissions. To ensure a geographically representative sample of the types of stations and different categories of repair providers, we employed
                            a stratified random sampling method.</br>

                            <strong>2. Modelling of emissions test failures</strong></br>
                            This entailed a high-level exploratory analysis spanning tests conducted through all of 2017 and 2018 at every station. The dataset contained independent variables detailing vehicle and testing characteristics and one categorical dependent variable with
                            three values: test pass, test fail, and test rejected due to insufficient data from the vehicle’s onboard computer. Accounting for differences in testing requirements based on car age and inferring a minimum time elapse between
                            yearly tests for older vehicles guided our process and gave us a higher degree of confidence in our findings.</br>

                            <strong>3. Spatial analysis: Local Moran’s I and geographically weighted regression </strong></br>
                            To identify local patterns of spatial association between stations’ testing frequencies, we conducted Local Moran’s I analysis (Anselin 1995) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) using ArcGIS to explore the relationship between testing frequency
                            and local population characteristics (Fotheringham et al. 2003).</br>

                            <strong>4. Interactive map development and user experience testing </strong></br>
                            With the verified pricing data, we developed an interactive web application to display map-based pricing data using the Python Dash visualization framework. To optimize the end user’s interactive experience, we conducted two rounds of user experience
                            testing.

                        <p>
                            1. We have built a prototype web application that displays locations of testing facilities with detailed information on each of them and filter feature based on zip code and price range.Application will be used by county residents and our intuition and
                            domain knowledge of our mentor indicated that filtering specifically by zip code will allow users to quickly select the most convenient facilities, while price filter will add transparency to existing pricing schemes and provide
                            a more informed and economically transparent facility selection process.
                            </br>

                            2. The main outcomes from our analysis include Managers suggested average of 35$ (similar to current county average) as proposed price cap. Around 63% of managers claimed not to offer testing after a price cap is introduced. 60% of managers would be willing
                            to participate in government subsidy programs that would foster timely repairs.</br>

                            3. To support stakeholder decision-making, we have calculated multiple statistics on testing in the county based on the data. We estimated number of initial tests per test result in each year (2017-2018). We calculated the average cost of testing and
                            average price across all tests.
                            <ul>
                                <li>Around 7% of initial OBDII tests do not pass, where 4% results are rejects (vehicle not yet ready to take the test due to technical conditions), and 3% are fails (vehicle did not pass the test).</li>
                                <li>Average price of all OBDII tests is currently 33.95$ (to compare, in Cache County, UT price cap is set at 15$, so the difference is significant).Initial results and all statistics have been reported to the stakeholder.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h2 class="major"> Conclusions</h2>
                        <p> Major risks of the project are associated with communication and delivery. In the research plan we indicate that some steps might require iteration - those include analytical framework development and application development. Therefore,
                            timely delivery will highly depend on successful collaboration with the stakeholder, and among team members, to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings and extensions. Another risk resides in the team’s capability to deliver high
                            quality products to the end users. Because our stakeholder is a government institution and our work might have sufficient impact on the entire vehicle emission test program, it is crucial to ensure we meet expectations and
                            produce high-end deliverables. To mitigate this risk we often sought advice from more experienced peers, eg. We have contacted professional UX designer to conduct our application tests. We also tried to quickly identify potentially
                            difficult tasks and issues to address them together and find solutions during team calls or meetings.
