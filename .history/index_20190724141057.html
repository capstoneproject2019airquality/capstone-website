                        <p align="left">
                            Salt Lake County oversees a vehicle emissions testing program to ensure compliance with federal air quality standards. Motorists annually spend millions of dollars for inspections carried out under this program.
                            <br/></br>However, it is not subject to cost controls and suffers from programmatic inefficiencies wherein a large number of compliant vehicles undergo testing and a small number of high-polluting vehicles forgo timely repair.
                            Using survey-based emissions test pricing data, we assess through empirical and spatial autocorrelation analysis the potential economic impact of instituting both emissions test price caps and subsidies to fund compliance repairs.
                            </br><br/> We conducted two sub-projects: Project A - Economic revision of testing services price schemes; Project B - Modelling of emission test failures.

                        <p align="left">The Salt Lake County vehicle emissions testing program suffers from uncontrolled transactional cost burdens for motorists and is not capable of tracking noncompliant vehicles. How can we leverage Salt Lake County test pricing and
                            test results data to reduce cost inefficiencies for motorists and improve overall efficiency of the I/M program for local government? This project proposes to support Salt Lake County regulators in the exploration and development
                            of policies aiming at establishing new cost efficiencies and improving overall efficiency of the program through exploration of repair incentives.
                            <br/></br>Through empirical and spatial analysis of service provider-level and vehicle-level data, we sought to identify testing price points that can accomplish a decrease in cost per ton of reduced pollutant emissions while
                            preserving adequate geographic service availability within the County.

                        <p align="right"> <strong>1.County-wide testing service provider records dataset</strong>
                            </br> The dataset contains average per-station testing price data for the first two months of 2019 including 435 rows of detail for each test station within Salt Lake County: a unique station ID, test fees, the station name,
                            and street address along with city name and zip codes. The data are limited in that they do not contain point geographies, detail on any additional taxes and fees, and station type categorization. This initial dataset was limited
                            in that it did not contain point geographies and applicable fees or tax additions to prices, nor did it discern service providers offering test services from those that supplement testing with repair services.
                            </br>
                            <strong>2.Survey resulting dataset</strong></br>The resulting dataset provided the population of test providers from which we later drew a stratified simple random sample of 35 providers to conduct the more detailed price cap
                            and repair subsidy survey. This data also supported the public-facing interactive web application that allows county motorists to explore test provider location and price details. </br>
                            <strong>3.Specific-vehicle emissions testing results dataset</strong>
                            </br>The dataset contains 1.646 million observations on individual emissions tests for years 2017 and 2018, covering vehicle characteristics of model year, type, class, and weight, and test parameters of test station ID, location,
                            type, and test result. The station ID key permitted a join to the original pricing dataset containing geocoded point locations, thus permitting removal of the hard-to-standardize location variables.

                        <h2 class="major"> Methodology </h2>
                        <p align="left">
                            <strong>1. Stratified sampling and phone call survey</strong></br>
                            Our sampling plan and survey questions focused on three objectives: assessing the viability of a price cap for all emissions tests in Salt Lake County; assessing how many stations would still offer testing at a price of 15 dollars; and assessing the providers’
                            interests in participating in a program subsidizing needed repairs to comply with emissions. To ensure a geographically representative sample of the types of stations and different categories of repair providers, we employed
                            a stratified random sampling method.</br>

                            <strong>2. Modelling of emissions test failures</strong></br>
                            This entailed a high-level exploratory analysis spanning tests conducted through all of 2017 and 2018 at every station. The dataset contained independent variables detailing vehicle and testing characteristics and one categorical dependent variable with
                            three values: test pass, test fail, and test rejected due to insufficient data from the vehicle’s onboard computer. Accounting for differences in testing requirements based on car age and inferring a minimum time elapse between
                            yearly tests for older vehicles guided our process and gave us a higher degree of confidence in our findings.</br>

                            <strong>3. Spatial analysis: Local Moran’s I and geographically weighted regression </strong></br>
                            To identify local patterns of spatial association between stations’ testing frequencies, we conducted Local Moran’s I analysis (Anselin 1995) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) using ArcGIS to explore the relationship between testing frequency
                            and local population characteristics (Fotheringham et al. 2003).</br>

                            <strong>4. Interactive map development and user experience testing </strong></br>
                            With the verified pricing data, we developed an interactive web application to display map-based pricing data using the Python Dash visualization framework. To optimize the end user’s interactive experience, we conducted two rounds of user experience
                            testing.

                        <p align="left">
                            <p>1. Discrepancies emerged between the prices contained in the County data and the prices facilities reported during data collection and verification of current pricing and services. Such differences suggest testing prices are
                                dynamic and frequently modified. Our phone survey of testing providers revealed a generally negative attitude towards imposing a price cap, even though caps exist in neighboring counties. More than 62% of respondents claimed
                                not to be willing to offer testing if a price cap were introduced. However, most respondents (60%) indicated a willingness to participate in a subsidized program designed to incentivize early repairs. The proposed price
                                cap of 15 dollars, well below the current average price of 34 dollars.In contrast, imposition of a 30-dollar cap that is still lower than the current average price, while utilizing subsidies for an early repair program,
                                improves both cost effectiveness and pollution reduction. </br>

                                </br>

                                2. Spatial analysis of testing facilities and their corresponding test volumes reflected generally good spatial coverage across the county. Use of Local Moran’s I helped us identify regions were some disruption in availability could occur. We identified
                                two statistically significant high emissions test frequency clusters, outliers with low test frequencies surrounded by high frequency values and outliers with high test frequencies surrounded by low frequency clusters.
                                GWR results indicated no strong correlation between testing frequencies and population characteristics. From a policymaking perspective, these results, particularly the presence of two large high testing frequency/high
                                population clusters, suggest adequate geographic availability.

                                3. Isolation of OBD tests on vehicles of model years 23 years and newer revealed a ~93% initial test pass rate, controlling for increased latitude in testing requirements of vehicles under six years of age. The high initial-test pass rate suggests the
                                existing blanket approach requiring nearly all vehicles to undergo emissions testing is not a cost-effective method of pollution reduction.The development of methods to selectively identify that small proportion of vehicles
                                most likely to be emissions violators and participants in a subsidized repair program would be a useful exercise in further research.</br>
                                </br>
                                4. We built a prototype web application that displays locations of testing facilities with detailed information on each of them and filter feature based on zip code and price range.Application will be used by county residents and our intuition and domain
                                knowledge of our mentor indicated that filtering specifically by zip code will allow users to quickly select the most convenient facilities, while price filter will add transparency to existing pricing schemes and provide
                                a more informed and economically transparent facility selection process.</br>

                        <p align="left">To improve the cost efficiency and programmatic effectiveness of Salt Lake County’s emissions testing program, we sought to identify emissions testing price points that can decrease costs to motorists per ton of reduced pollutant
                            emissions while preserving adequate geographic service availability within the County.

                                <li>Our survey results suggested the introduction of a price cap of 30 dollars and introduction of a subsidized early repair program would reduce the average testing price within the county while improving the program’s pollution-reduction
                                    effectiveness.
                                </li>
                                <li>A high-level exploratory analysis of test data on vehicle-level data demonstrated that OBD tests on vehicles of model years 23 years and newer revealed a ~93% initial test pass rate.The high quality and detail inherent
                                    in the testing data make statistical modeling of emissions test results a useful starting point in further research. </li>
                                <li>Spatial analysis on testing data joined with census data revealed local patterns of spatial association between stations’ testing frequencies and population density, suggesting adequate geographic distribution of testing
                                    stations and moderate travel and transaction costs for motorists seeking test services. </li>
                                <li>Our development of an interactive web application featuring price and geographic filter functionality to provide county residents with a useful tool for identifying the most convenient testing facilities adds transparency
